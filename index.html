<p><strong>Mechanical Turk and AWS Workshop - December 5th, 2013 at UC Merced</strong></p>

<p>This workshop was geared towards social science researchers who had never used Amazon Web Services or Mechanical Turk. Topics that were touched on included What is MTurk?, How much should you pay?, Installing MTurkR in RStudio, Accessing your AWS Security Credentials, Messaging Workers thought MTurkR, Sending SMS and Email messages though AWS, and Assigning Qualifications in MTurk. </p>

<p><strong>Mechanical Turk and AWS Workshop - February 3rd, 2014 at UC Merced</strong></p>

<p>This workshop is almost the same as the workshop I ran in the Fall semester, I added a few details about Turkopticon, the people who run Turkopticon, the author of MTurkR and myself.
