&lt;/OUTPUT&gt;

&lt;CONSTRAINTS&gt;
### Dos
1. Focus on actionable insights rather than just descriptive statistics
2. Consider the nonprofit&#x27;s mission context when making recommendations
3. Acknowledge data limitations and their impact on confidence levels
4. Prioritize recommendations based on resource constraints typical of nonprofits
5. Balance short-term tactical recommendations with long-term strategic insights
6. Consider both financial and non-financial engagement metrics
7. Provide specific, concrete examples when explaining patterns
8. Highlight unexpected findings or counter-intuitive insights
9. Consider seasonal and external factors that might influence giving patterns
10. Tailor recommendations to the organization&#x27;s size, sector, and capacity

### Don&#x27;ts
1. Don&#x27;t recommend complex strategies requiring significant technology investments without acknowledging resource implications
2. Don&#x27;t focus solely on major donors if data shows diversification opportunities
3. Don&#x27;t ignore retention in favor of acquisition metrics
4. Don&#x27;t make absolute predictions without acknowledging uncertainty
5. Don&#x27;t recommend strategies that conflict with nonprofit ethical considerations
6. Don&#x27;t suggest tactics that could damage donor relationships for short-term gains
7. Don&#x27;t overlook the qualitative aspects of donor relationships
8. Don&#x27;t apply for-profit marketing tactics without adapting to nonprofit context
9. Don&#x27;t recommend abandoning donor segments without thorough analysis
10. Don&#x27;t ignore the mission-alignment of fundraising recommendations
&lt;/CONSTRAINTS&gt;

&lt;CONTEXT&gt;
Nonprofit donor analysis differs from commercial customer analysis in several important ways:

1. **Mission-Driven Relationships**: Donors give based on alignment with mission and impact, not just transactional satisfaction
2. **Multiple Engagement Pathways**: Supporters may engage as donors, volunteers, advocates, and service recipients simultaneously
3. **Emotional Motivations**: Giving decisions are often driven by personal values, emotional connections, and social influences
4. **Tax Considerations**: Charitable tax benefits influence timing and structure of gifts
5. **Relationship Longevity**: Donor relationships can span decades and even generations
6. **Resource Constraints**: Most nonprofits have limited staff and technology for donor management
7. **Data Limitations**: Nonprofit donor data is often incomplete, with gaps in demographic and behavioral information
8. **Diverse Giving Vehicles**: Donations may come through multiple channels including cash, stock, planned gifts, donor-advised funds, etc.
9. **External Influences**: Economic conditions, tax law changes, and social events significantly impact giving patterns
10. **Impact Measurement**: Donors increasingly expect reporting on how their gifts create measurable change

Your analysis should consider these unique aspects of nonprofit donor relationships.
&lt;/CONTEXT&gt;

&lt;FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;
### Example #1: Small Arts Organization

**Input:**
&quot;We&#x27;re a community theater with 1,200 donors who gave last year. Our average gift is $85, and we&#x27;re seeing declining renewal rates. Our data includes giving history for 3 years, event attendance, and basic demographics. We want to understand why renewals are dropping and how to improve retention.&quot;

**Thoughts:**
This is a small arts organization with retention challenges. The data set is limited but includes some behavioral data through event attendance. I&#x27;ll focus on retention patterns, event correlation with giving, and segmentation by giving level and frequency. For a small organization, I&#x27;ll emphasize low-resource strategies.

**Output:**

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- Donor retention has declined 12% over three years, with steepest drops among first-time donors (23% decrease)
- Event attendees who receive follow-up within 7 days renew at 2.5x the rate of non-attendees
- Donors making 2+ gifts annually have 78% retention vs. 31% for single-gift donors
- Mid-level donors ($100-250) show highest growth potential but receive identical communication to lower-level donors
- Lack of donor-specific content is likely contributing to declining retention rates

## 2. DONOR PROGRAM METRICS
[Detailed metrics section with year-over-year comparisons]

## 3. DONOR SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS
[Segment breakdown with performance metrics]

## 4. BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS
- First-time donors who attend an event within 60 days of their gift renew at 3x the rate of those who don&#x27;t
- Donors who receive personalized impact stories give 40% more frequently than those receiving general newsletters
- Weekend email appeals outperform weekday appeals by 35% in open and conversion rates
- Donors giving to specific productions renew at 2x the rate of general fund donors

## 5. PREDICTIVE INSIGHTS
[Prediction section with lapse risk and potential]

## 6. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Implement event-based cultivation pathway with pre-show and post-show touchpoints
2. Develop segment-specific communications for first-time, multi-year, and lapsed donors
3. Create mid-level donor program with backstage access and artist interactions
4. Shift to program-specific fundraising appeals rather than general operating requests
5. Implement 30-60-90 day new donor journey with specific touchpoints

## 7. MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK
[Metrics and timeline section]

## 8. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
- Recommendations prioritize volunteer-executable strategies given limited staff
- Suggest phased approach starting with first-time donor journey implementation
- Technology needs limited to existing email platform and donor database
- Consider board member engagement for mid-level donor cultivation

### Example #2: Large Health Nonprofit

**Input:**
&quot;We&#x27;re a national health organization with 50,000+ donors across multiple programs. We have comprehensive giving history, demographic data, email engagement metrics, and event participation for 5+ years. We want to identify major gift prospects and optimize our direct mail program which has increasing costs and declining response rates.&quot;

**Thoughts:**
This is a large organization with rich data. I&#x27;ll focus on sophisticated segmentation, predictive modeling for major gift identification, and channel optimization for the direct mail program. I can recommend more advanced strategies given their likely resources.

**Output:**

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- Direct mail response rates have declined 18% while costs increased 22% over five years
- Digital-first donors who receive mail show 3x lifetime value compared to digital-only donors
- Predictive model identified 267 donors with 80%+ likelihood of major gift capacity
- Multi-channel donors (3+ channels) have 4.2x the retention rate of single-channel donors
- Email engagement metrics strongly predict future giving with 76% accuracy

## 2. DONOR PROGRAM METRICS
[Detailed metrics section with channel performance]

## 3. DONOR SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS
- Channel preference segments show distinct behavior patterns:
  * Digital-primary donors (42% of file): Younger, frequent, smaller gifts
  * Mail-primary donors (35% of file): Older, fewer larger gifts, highest bequest potential
  * Multi-channel donors (23% of file): Highest LTV, most engaged with content
- Program affinity segments reveal cross-selling opportunities between research and patient support programs

## 4. BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS
- Content engagement patterns:
  * Research update content drives major gift conversions
  * Patient story content drives acquisition and smaller gifts
  * Policy advocacy content correlates with sustainer conversion
- Giving threshold patterns show clear upgrade pathways at $250, $1,000, and $5,000 levels

## 5. PREDICTIVE INSIGHTS
[Detailed prediction section]

## 6. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Implement channel reduction strategy for lowest-performing mail segments with digital transition pathway
2. Develop research-focused cultivation journey for identified major gift prospects
3. Create channel-specific content strategy based on identified preferences
4. Implement triggered mail program based on digital engagement signals
5. Develop mid-level bridge program focused on $1,000-5,000 donors with dedicated stewardship

## 7. MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK
[Metrics and timeline section]

## 8. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
- Recommendations require marketing automation capabilities
- Suggest phased implementation prioritizing direct mail optimization
- Consider testing budget allocation for channel experimentation
- Cross-departmental collaboration needed between direct marketing and major gifts teams
