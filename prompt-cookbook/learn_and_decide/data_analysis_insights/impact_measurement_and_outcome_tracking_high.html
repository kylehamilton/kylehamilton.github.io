   - Analyze the data within the context of [ORGANIZATION_NAME]&#x27;s mission statement
   - Compare results against any established benchmarks, targets, or previous performance periods

3. **Impact Measurement**
   - Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to [PROGRAM_NAME]
   - Analyze both outputs (activities/services delivered) and outcomes (changes achieved)
   - Identify any statistically significant changes or correlations in the data
   - Assess progress toward stated impact goals

4. **Stakeholder Perspective Integration**
   - Analyze qualitative feedback from program participants, staff, and other stakeholders
   - Identify recurring themes, success stories, and areas for improvement
   - Connect quantitative metrics with qualitative insights for a holistic view

5. **Strategic Insight Development**
   - Identify the most significant findings that demonstrate program impact
   - Highlight unexpected results or emerging trends that warrant attention
   - Analyze external factors that may have influenced outcomes
   - Develop actionable recommendations based on the data analysis
&lt;/STEPS&gt;

&lt;OUTPUT&gt;
Provide your analysis in the following structured format:

1. **Executive Summary** (250-300 words)
   - Key findings and their significance to [ORGANIZATION_NAME]&#x27;s mission
   - Overall assessment of program impact
   - 3-5 most important actionable recommendations

2. **Data Analysis** (Detailed breakdown)
   - Summary of data quality and limitations
   - Analysis of key metrics with visual representations (described in text)
   - Comparative analysis (over time, against benchmarks, between programs)
   - Statistical significance of findings (where applicable)

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Evaluation of outputs vs. outcomes achieved
   - Progress toward stated impact goals
   - Return on investment or cost-effectiveness analysis (if data permits)
   - Unexpected or secondary impacts identified

4. **Stakeholder Insights**
   - Key themes from qualitative feedback
   - Beneficiary/participant experience highlights
   - Success stories that illustrate impact (anonymized as needed)
   - Areas for improvement based on stakeholder feedback

5. **Strategic Recommendations**
   - 5-7 specific, actionable recommendations prioritized by:
     a) Potential impact on mission fulfillment
     b) Resource requirements for implementation
     c) Timeline (short-term vs. long-term)
   - Suggested metrics to track for each recommendation
   - Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

6. **Data Collection Improvements**
   - Gaps in current measurement approach
   - Suggestions for enhancing future data collection
   - Recommended frequency and methods for ongoing evaluation
&lt;/OUTPUT&gt;

&lt;CONSTRAINTS&gt;
1. **Dos**
   - Use plain, accessible language avoiding excessive jargon
   - Acknowledge data limitations honestly and transparently
   - Focus on actionable insights rather than just describing data
   - Consider resource constraints when making recommendations
   - Balance quantitative metrics with qualitative human impact stories
   - Differentiate between correlation and causation in your analysis
   - Prioritize insights relevant to [ORGANIZATION_NAME]&#x27;s specific mission and goals
   - Consider both internal program improvements and external reporting needs

2. **Don&#x27;ts**
   - Don&#x27;t make claims of impact that aren&#x27;t supported by the data
   - Don&#x27;t recommend complex measurement systems requiring significant resources
   - Don&#x27;t use corporate metrics inappropriate for nonprofit contexts
   - Don&#x27;t focus solely on quantitative data while ignoring qualitative insights
   - Don&#x27;t compare to dissimilar organizations or programs without appropriate context
   - Don&#x27;t suggest unrealistic data collection methods for resource-constrained organizations
   - Don&#x27;t overlook small but meaningful impacts in pursuit of dramatic results
   - Don&#x27;t use technical statistical terminology without clear explanations
&lt;/CONSTRAINTS&gt;

&lt;CONTEXT&gt;
Nonprofit impact measurement differs from corporate performance analysis in several important ways:

- **Mission-Centric**: Success is measured by mission advancement, not profit
- **Multiple Stakeholders**: Must consider diverse perspectives (funders, beneficiaries, staff, board)
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited staff time and expertise for complex data analysis
- **Qualitative Value**: Many important outcomes are difficult to quantify
- **Attribution Challenges**: Difficult to prove direct causation in complex social issues
- **Long-Term Horizons**: Meaningful change often occurs over extended timeframes
- **Ethical Considerations**: Data collection must respect dignity and privacy of vulnerable populations

Effective nonprofit measurement balances accountability requirements with learning opportunities, using data not just to prove impact but to improve programs. The most valuable insights often combine quantitative metrics with qualitative understanding of how and why change occurs.
&lt;/CONTEXT&gt;

&lt;FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;
### Example #1: Youth Mentoring Program

**Input:**
- Quarterly survey data from 120 youth participants (ages 12-18)
- Pre/post assessments measuring self-confidence, academic engagement
- Attendance records for mentoring sessions
- Qualitative feedback from participants, parents, and mentors
- Program goal: Improve academic outcomes and self-confidence for at-risk youth

**Thoughts:**
- Data shows 85% attendance rate with significant drop-off in month 3
- Pre/post assessments show modest improvements in self-confidence (+12%) but minimal change in academic metrics
- Qualitative feedback indicates strong mentor relationships but scheduling challenges
- Parent feedback consistently mentions improved behavior at home
- Need to explore why academic outcomes aren&#x27;t improving despite other positive indicators

**Output:**

1. **Executive Summary**
   Youth Mentoring Program demonstrates meaningful impact on participants&#x27; self-confidence and home behavior, with 73% of participants showing measurable improvement in self-reported confidence metrics. However, the program is not yet achieving its stated goal of improving academic outcomes, with only 8% of participants showing grade improvements. The strong relationship foundation provides an excellent platform for academic intervention, but program modifications are needed. Key recommendations include: implementing structured academic support components, addressing the month 3 attendance drop through schedule adjustments, and developing specific metrics to track the newly identified home behavior improvements.

2. **Data Analysis**
   [Detailed analysis section with specific metrics]

3. **Impact Assessment**
   While the program successfully builds mentoring relationships (output), it has not yet translated these relationships into academic improvements (intended outcome). However, an unexpected outcome—improved home behavior—suggests the program creates value in ways not initially measured...

### Example #2: Environmental Conservation Program

**Input:**
- Water quality measurements from 15 testing sites over 24 months
- Volunteer participation data (hours, activities, retention)
- Community survey responses about environmental awareness
- Photos documenting physical changes to restoration sites
- Program goal: Improve watershed health through community-led restoration

**Thoughts:**
- Water quality shows statistically significant improvement at 9/15 sites
- Volunteer retention is excellent (78%) but new recruitment is declining
- Community awareness surveys show increased knowledge but limited behavior change
- Visual documentation shows dramatic physical improvements at restoration sites
- Need to connect volunteer activities more directly to measurable outcomes

**Output:**

1. **Executive Summary**
   The Watershed Restoration Initiative has achieved measurable ecological improvements, with 60% of testing sites showing statistically significant water quality enhancements over the 24-month period. The program excels at volunteer retention (78% continuing beyond 6 months) and has created visible habitat improvements documented through comparative photography. However, community behavior change lags behind awareness metrics, and volunteer recruitment has declined by 23% in the past two quarters. Recommendations focus on: strengthening the connection between volunteer activities and measurable outcomes, implementing a targeted recruitment strategy, and developing specific community behavior change initiatives beyond awareness building.
