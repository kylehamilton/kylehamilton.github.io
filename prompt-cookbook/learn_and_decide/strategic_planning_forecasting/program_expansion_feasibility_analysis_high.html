&lt;/OUTPUT&gt;

&lt;CONSTRAINTS&gt;
1. **Dos**
   - Use nonprofit-specific metrics and terminology (e.g., mission impact, beneficiary outcomes, donor sustainability)
   - Maintain a balanced perspective considering both mission impact and financial sustainability
   - Incorporate both quantitative data and qualitative insights in your analysis
   - Consider resource constraints realistic for nonprofit operations
   - Acknowledge data limitations and suggest reasonable assumptions when necessary
   - Provide actionable recommendations that can be implemented with typical nonprofit resources
   - Consider the unique stakeholder ecosystem (board, donors, volunteers, staff, beneficiaries)
   - Highlight ethical considerations specific to the target population
   - Include capacity building recommendations alongside expansion plans

2. **Don&#x27;ts**
   - Don&#x27;t apply purely for-profit business metrics without adaptation to nonprofit context
   - Don&#x27;t ignore mission alignment in favor of financial opportunities
   - Don&#x27;t recommend unrealistic resource requirements beyond typical nonprofit capacity
   - Don&#x27;t overlook volunteer engagement and community partnership opportunities
   - Don&#x27;t focus solely on growth metrics without considering quality of service
   - Don&#x27;t make assumptions about funding availability without evidence
   - Don&#x27;t recommend complex technical solutions without considering implementation capacity
   - Don&#x27;t ignore regulatory or compliance requirements specific to nonprofit operations
   - Don&#x27;t underestimate the importance of board and donor buy-in for expansion
&lt;/CONSTRAINTS&gt;

&lt;CONTEXT&gt;
When analyzing program expansion feasibility for nonprofits, consider these contextual factors:

1. **Nonprofit Sector Trends**
   - Increasing focus on measurable outcomes and impact reporting
   - Growing competition for limited funding resources
   - Shift toward collaborative models and collective impact approaches
   - Increasing demand for data-driven decision making
   - Growing emphasis on sustainability and earned income strategies

2. **Resource Realities**
   - Most nonprofits operate with limited overhead and administrative capacity
   - Staff often wear multiple hats and have diverse responsibilities
   - Volunteer management adds complexity to capacity planning
   - Funding restrictions may limit flexibility in resource allocation
   - Technology adoption may lag behind for-profit sector

3. **Stakeholder Considerations**
   - Board approval typically required for significant expansions
   - Donor preferences influence program development
   - Community input essential for program legitimacy
   - Staff and volunteer buy-in critical for implementation
   - Beneficiary needs must remain central to decision-making

4. **Impact Measurement Challenges**
   - Outcomes may take years to manifest
   - Attribution challenges in complex social interventions
   - Qualitative impacts often difficult to quantify
   - Baseline data may be limited or unavailable
   - Measurement capacity varies widely across organizations
&lt;/CONTEXT&gt;

&lt;FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;
Here are examples of program expansion feasibility analyses:

### Example #1: Community Health Education Program Expansion

**Input:**
- Organization: HealthReach Community Coalition
- Current Program: Diabetes Prevention Workshops in urban areas
- Expansion Consideration: Extending to 5 rural counties with high diabetes rates
- Current Resources: 2 full-time health educators, $75,000 annual budget, curriculum materials
- Expansion Goal: Reach 500 additional at-risk individuals annually
- Constraints: Limited rural transportation infrastructure, no existing relationships in target counties

**Analysis Excerpt:**
The rural expansion of HealthReach&#x27;s Diabetes Prevention Program shows moderate feasibility with significant modifications. While need is well-documented (diabetes rates 23% above state average in target counties), the current delivery model requires adaptation for rural contexts.

Resource requirements include:
- $45,000 in additional annual funding (60% increase)
- 1 additional full-time health educator with rural experience
- Transportation solutions for participants or mobile delivery capability
- Local partner organizations in each county for facility use

Risk assessment identified limited rural healthcare infrastructure as the highest concern (High probability, High impact). Mitigation requires establishing partnerships with county extension offices, religious organizations, and rural school districts to provide accessible venues.

Financial sustainability analysis indicates potential funding through the Rural Healthcare Initiative grant ($30,000/year for 3 years) and a sliding scale fee structure generating approximately $15,000 annually. Cost per participant increases from $62 to $90 due to travel costs and smaller group sizes.

**Recommendation:**
Proceed with modified phased approach:
1. Pilot in 2 counties with strongest partnership potential (Year 1)
2. Evaluate and refine delivery model
3. Expand to remaining counties if pilot meets success metrics
4. Develop train-the-trainer model for long-term sustainability

Critical success factors include securing dedicated rural outreach funding, establishing minimum of 3 community partners per county, and adapting curriculum for lower health literacy levels.

### Example #2: Youth Mentoring Program Geographic Expansion

**Input:**
- Organization: FuturePath Mentoring
- Current Program: One-to-one mentoring for at-risk youth in Springfield metro area
- Expansion Consideration: Adding two neighboring counties
- Current Resources: 1 program manager, 1 volunteer coordinator, 85 active volunteer mentors, $120,000 annual budget
- Expansion Goal: Serve 50 additional youth (current: 85 youth)
- Constraints: Volunteer recruitment challenges, transportation barriers, background check costs

**Analysis Excerpt:**
The geographic expansion of FuturePath&#x27;s mentoring program demonstrates high feasibility for Westfield County but low feasibility for Riverdale County based on our analysis.

Westfield County shows strong potential with:
- Documented need (28% youth poverty rate)
- Strong potential partner organizations (2 colleges, active community foundation)
- Geographic proximity allowing shared staff oversight
- Public transportation connections to main office

Riverdale County presents significant challenges:
- 45-minute drive from main office with no public transportation
- Limited potential volunteer pool (aging population)
- No identified partner organizations for office space
- Competing youth service provider already established

Resource requirements for Westfield expansion only:
- $35,000 additional annual funding (29% increase)
- Part-time volunteer coordinator (20 hours/week)
- Satellite office space (potential in-kind donation from community college)
- Background check costs for 30 new volunteers ($1,500)

**Recommendation:**
Proceed with Westfield County expansion only, using a phased approach:
1. Establish partnership with Westfield Community College for office space and volunteer recruitment
2. Hire part-time coordinator focused on volunteer recruitment and training
3. Begin with 15 mentor-mentee matches in first 6 months
4. Scale to full capacity (50 matches) by end of year 2

For Riverdale County, recommend partnership with existing youth service provider rather than direct program expansion. Consider developing shared training resources and referral system instead of independent operation.
&lt;/FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;

&lt;RECAP&gt;
To create an effective program expansion feasibility analysis for [ORGANIZATION_NAME]&#x27;s [PROGRAM_NAME], remember to:

1. Conduct a comprehensive assessment across all eight dimensions (current program, opportunity, resources, risks, financial sustainability, impact, implementation, and final recommendation)

2. Balance mission impact with financial sustainability throughout your analysis

3. Provide specific, actionable recommendations tailored to nonprofit realities

4. Structure your output with the required nine components, maintaining the specified word counts

5. Consider the unique stakeholder ecosystem of nonprofits in your analysis

6. Acknowledge data limitations and make reasonable assumptions when necessary

7. Recommend realistic resource requirements that align with nonprofit capacity

8. Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative considerations

9. Provide a clear implementation roadmap with decision points and success criteria

10. Maintain focus on the organization&#x27;s mission and beneficiary needs throughout

This analysis should serve as a decision-making tool for nonprofit leadership, providing them with the information needed to make a strategic, informed choice about program expansion while respecting the unique constraints and opportunities of the nonprofit sector.
