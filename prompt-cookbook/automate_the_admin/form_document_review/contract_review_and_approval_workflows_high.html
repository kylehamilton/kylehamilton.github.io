&lt;FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;
### Example #1: Vendor Service Agreement

**Input:**
- Document: Professional cleaning service contract for nonprofit community center
- Key criteria: Must include background checks for staff, flexible termination, monthly billing
- Budget constraint: $12,000 annual maximum
- Timeline: Needed within 2 weeks

**Thoughts:**
This is a standard vendor agreement with direct service implications. The background check requirement is critical given the community center serves vulnerable populations. The contract is within budget but has concerning automatic renewal terms and lacks clear service quality metrics. The termination clause requires 60 days notice which could be problematic.

**Output:**

## CONTRACT REVIEW SUMMARY
**Document Title:** Professional Cleaning Services Agreement
**Document Type:** Vendor Service Contract
**Parties Involved:** Community Wellness Nonprofit, CleanPro Services Inc.
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2023
**Term:** 12 months with automatic renewal
**Financial Commitment:** $950 monthly ($11,400 annually)

## KEY FINDINGS
1. **Compliance Assessment:**
   - Contract includes required insurance coverage (Section 4.2)
   - Missing required background check provision for vendor staff (Section 3)
   - Vendor confidentiality clause present but lacks specific reference to client data (Section 7.1)

2. **Financial Impact:**
   - Monthly cost within budget at $950/month
   - Automatic 5% annual increase clause (Section 5.3) would exceed budget in year 2
   - No performance-based payment provisions or service quality metrics

3. **Risk Evaluation:**
   - 60-day termination notice exceeds organizational standard of 30 days (Section 9.2)
   - Indemnification clause (Section 8) favors vendor with limited liability
   - No clear remediation process for service quality issues

4. **Mission Alignment:**
   - Service supports clean, safe environment for program participants
   - Vendor&#x27;s stated values align with organization&#x27;s commitment to sustainability
   - No community benefit components (e.g., job training, living wage commitment)

## RECOMMENDATION
**Decision:** APPROVE WITH CHANGES

**Required Changes:**
1. Add background check requirement for all vendor staff (Section 3)
2. Modify termination clause to 30-day notice period (Section 9.2)
3. Remove automatic price increase or cap at 3% annually (Section 5.3)
4. Add service quality metrics and remediation process (Section 2)

**Rationale:** The agreement meets basic needs and budget requirements but requires modifications to address security concerns and ensure flexibility.

**Next Steps:**
1. Return contract to Operations Director with change requests
2. Schedule follow-up negotiation call with vendor
3. Aim to finalize within 7 days to meet implementation timeline

### Example #2: Grant Agreement

**Input:**
- Document: Foundation grant agreement for youth program
**Document Type:** Grant Agreement
- Key criteria: Program must serve at least 100 youth, quarterly reporting required
- Grant amount: $50,000 over 12 months
- Organizational priority: Building sustainable funding

**Thoughts:**
This is a standard foundation grant agreement with typical reporting requirements. The grant aligns well with the organization&#x27;s youth program but has some concerning intellectual property provisions regarding program materials. The reporting timeline is more frequent than our standard process, which could create administrative burden. The payment schedule is favorable with 75% upfront.

**Output:**

## CONTRACT REVIEW SUMMARY
**Document Title:** Youth Leadership Program Grant Agreement
**Document Type:** Foundation Grant Agreement
**Parties Involved:** Community Foundation, Youth Empowerment Nonprofit
**Effective Date:** March 1, 2023
**Term:** 12 months
**Financial Commitment:** $50,000 incoming (75% upfront, 25% upon final report)

## KEY FINDINGS
1. **Compliance Assessment:**
   - Grant purpose aligns with organizational mission and 501(c)(3) status
   - Reporting requirements exceed standard organizational practice (quarterly vs. semi-annual)
   - Required acknowledgment language for marketing materials is provided (Exhibit B)

2. **Financial Impact:**
   - Grant amount matches proposal and budget
   - Favorable payment schedule (75% upfront)
   - Budget modification clause requires approval for changes exceeding 10% of any line item
   - No matching requirement

3. **Risk Evaluation:**
   - Intellectual property clause (Section 6.2) grants foundation rights to all program materials
   - Return of funds provision for non-compliance is standard but broadly written
   - Requirement to serve minimum 100 youth with documentation

4. **Mission Alignment:**
   - Directly supports strategic priority of expanding youth leadership programming
   - Evaluation metrics align with organization&#x27;s theory of change
   - Builds relationship with new funding partner for potential future support

## RECOMMENDATION
**Decision:** APPROVE WITH CHANGES

**Required Changes:**
1. Modify intellectual property clause to retain ownership of existing materials (Section 6.2)
2. Request semi-annual rather than quarterly reporting schedule (Section 4.1)
3. Clarify &quot;material changes&quot; definition in budget modification clause (Section 3.3)

**Rationale:** The grant provides significant support for a core program with favorable payment terms. Requested changes address administrative burden and protect intellectual property.

**Next Steps:**
1. Submit change requests to Program Director for discussion with funder
2. Prepare tracking system for required participant documentation
3. Schedule grant kickoff meeting with program staff if approved
&lt;/FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;
