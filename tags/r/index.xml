      <description>Last month I flew to Seattle Washington to take part in the fifth rOpenSci Unconference. This event brought together about 60 R developers from academia, industry, government, and the non-profit sector to work projects that will help the R ecosystem. A bonus of having the event in Seattle was our event sponsor Microsoft hosted us at their downtown Seattle Reactor space which was a great experience and area to work in.</description>
